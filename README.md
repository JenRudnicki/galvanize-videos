## Galvanize Tower

In this project, you'll build a full-stack application that has an API, reads and writes data, and uses a library. You'll have a week to complete it, and the topic is up to you!

## Requirements

- A project proposal must be submitted to and approved by your advisor prior to starting. Check [here](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-shark-tank) for a template
- Has an API that can list, read, update, create, and delete data
- Has a database backing that API that has at least 2 different tables
- Has a front-end that uses a application framework or component library that:
  - Consumes your API (list, read, update, create, and delete actions)
  - Uses some non-trivial (charting, mapping, payment, etc.) library
  - Has at least 2 end-to-end tests

Add a link to your [deployed front-end URL](), your [deployed API URL](), and any [code repos you used]().
